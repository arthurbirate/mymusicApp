In this i am using java to make a music app which can only fetch music from the External storage of the device  but this is not final
the App still have issues which i will describe later as we proceed with the explanation.



# What to install

* you can use intellij(when creating the project you should choose the android platform and for the language you can either use java or kotlin)
* or android studio(android studio arm for mac users)


# Recommended configurations

on gradle.properties the following dependecies should be added:

* Dexter karumi this simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime. get it here <https://github.com/Karumi/Dexter>
*  for the audio visualiser which i am still working on... you can get it here  <https://github.com/aashrafh/AudioVisualizer>
